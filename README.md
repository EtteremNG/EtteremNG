## Libraries, external resources
The following resources were used during the development of EtteremNG:
	- https://xunit.net/: Open source unit testing tool: It was used to make sure the application still worked as intended after code changes/rewrites.
	- https://fonts.google.com/icons: Used for the application icon.
	- https://doxygen.nl/: Used to make the documentation you're looking at right now.

## System requirements
	- Operating System: Windows 7 or newer, or Linux/macOS/BSD if using [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/).
	- .NET Framework 4.7.2 must be installed for the application to work. [Download .NET Framework 4.7.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net472).
	- [Doxygen](https://doxygen.nl/download.html) main executable has to be in PATH for developer documentation to be generated.

## Building the software from source
To build the software from source, follow the instructions below:
	- Open `EtteremNG.sln` using a version of Visual Studio compatible with Visual Studio 2022 projects. (Visual Studio 2019 is also known to work)
	- After the project has loaded, press CTRL+F5 or click the "Start" button.
